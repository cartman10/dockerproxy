**Note:** Ensure that you have appropriate security measures in place to protect your Docker daemon and the exposed socket. Consider using strong authentication and authorization mechanisms.

### **Usage**

1. **Access the Docker Socket Proxy:**
   - Use your web browser to access `http://<your_home_assistant_ip>:2375`.
2. **Use a Docker Management Tool:**
   - Use tools like Portainer or other Docker management interfaces to connect to the exposed Docker socket.

### **Security Considerations**

- **Network Security:** Ensure your Home Assistant instance is secured with strong passwords, firewalls, and other security measures.
- **Docker Socket Access:** Limit access to the Docker socket to trusted users and applications.
